  <h1>2016 in figures</h1>
  <p>26 human beings and one bot, crunching hundreds of thousands of lines of code and working with scores of organisations around the world.</p>
  <p>It’s not <em>all</em> about the numbers, but they do give a good overview.</p>

        Phew! Thanks to some expansion at the top, we can call on the expertise of <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/about/board/">3 new trustees</a>, and 3 new <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/about/board/">non-executive directors</a> to help plot mySociety’s course.

        Every time we press the button marked ‘commit’, we’re making changes and additions to our code. This figure’s wildly up on last year’s (15,723) because of the diligent little EveryPolitician Bot. About which, more later.

  <p>We wish we could work with every single one of the organisations who applied for our development help. Sadly, there are only so many hours in the day. Until that changes, our vibrant <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/subscribe/">online communities and message groups</a> are there to give you support.</p>

      With our research program, we’re <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/research/">building the evidence base</a> for what works and why, and feeding that back into our own work and that of the Civic Tech sector.

  <p>Focus groups, Facebook ads, data investigations and on-the-ground visits help us ensure we’re actually making a difference.</p>

  <p>This year, we <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23752">evaluated citizen engagement</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2016/02/19/our-latest-research-citizen-engagement-in-new-zealand-and-australia/">investigated civic initiatives in New Zealand and Australia</a>.</p>

  <p>But we also conducted targeted research in FOI, Democracy, and Better Cities – more details in those sections.</p>

      <p><strong>Fun tapir fact:</strong> In Japan, the tapir shares its name with the folkloric <i>Baku</i>, a nightmare-devouring creature, made from parts left over after all the other animals had been created.</p>
